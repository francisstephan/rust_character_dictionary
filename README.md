# Rust Chinese character dictionary management

This a port to rust language of my [character dictionary manager](https://github.com/francisstephan/character_dictionary_manager) which was written in Go language.

It is a CRUD program written in rust with the `actix` web framework, the `tera` templating system and `sqlx` database crate, using the same sqlite3 database as the Go version. It also uses `htmx` and HTML5 validation, as did the Go version.
